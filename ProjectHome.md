Allows users in a small company to open a ticket for support.  User chooses from a pre-defined list of issues and then enters a title, short description and full description to their problem.  A ticket then gets generated with a copy of the ticket going to the user and to a pre-defined "HelpDesk" mailbox.

Features for the user include the ability to retrieve their ticket to check the status and / or to change some of the information they entered.

Features for administrator include the ability to search tickets by date range, username or specific ticket number.  Administrator can then enter a resolution, notes and close the ticket.

This is a PHP/MySQL web application.
